Catalog-level simulation of LSST DM stack measurements of
gravitationally-lensed quasars.

In this package we are experimenting with predicting `Source`, `Object`,
`DIASource` and `DIAObject` properties directly, by realizing
model lenses as mixtures of Gaussians. Our goals are to

1. Be able to generate large-volume catalog level lens simulations, to enable catalog-level lens finder training;

2. Enable a model-based interpretation of the LSST catalogs, for use in lens finding and light curve extraction.


## Set-up and testing

To use (and not develop) `SLRealizer`, you can pip install it with
```
pip install git+git://github.com/LSSTDESC/SLRealizer.git#egg=slrealizer
```

To help develop it, fork and clone the repo, `cd` to its `python` folder, and then install the package with
```
python setup.py develop
```
To run the tests, do
```
nosetests
```
